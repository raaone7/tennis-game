# Tennis Game Manager

Simulates a tennis game play, between 2 players on each side.

## Pre-requisites

`node.js` and `npm` are required to setup/run/test the project. Also, install pnpm for better overall experience

```sh
npm i pnpm -g
```

> *Note - `pnpm` is the recommended as it is much faster, however, the project also works with `npm` out of the box.*

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

    ```
    pnpm i
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Steps to run and test

1. To run a tennis match simulation

    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```
    or
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

2. To test the tennis match rules, for game, sets and match

    ```
    pnpm test
    ```
    or

    ```
